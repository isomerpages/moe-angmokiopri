**<font size=5>Information on 2020 Direct School Admission for Secondary Schools (DSA-Sec)</font>**

Dear Parents/Guardians,  

Please refer to the attached file for more information on DSA application procedures and key dates. You can also refer to the MOE website [(http://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)](http://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec) for more information and  to download the Portal User Guide and Application Template for use.

You may submit your child’s application online via the DSA-Sec Portal from 9am on 12 May 2020 to 3pm on 5 June 2020. Either parent may log in using SingPass to submit an application.

If you are unable to apply online for your child, please approach Mr Jagtar Singh from General Office for assistance. You can call him at 64520794 or email him at 
<a href="mailto:Jagtar_SINGH@schools.gov.sg">Jagtar_SINGH@schools.gov.sg</a>

To allow some time for processing by the school, you need to submit your child/ward's DSA application earlier. Please email Mr Jagtar latest by 4 June, 12pm, attaching the Application Template (Annex D) in your email. It would be much appreciated if you can follow-up with a call after the email to confirm that the school has received it.

Thank you.

Miss Soh Mei Ling
