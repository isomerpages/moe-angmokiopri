<div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="My Image" src="/images/Principal.jpeg"></div><p>Welcome to our school website.&nbsp; As you navigate the website, you will read about the stories of our amazing pupils, dedicated staff and supportive partners in Ang Mo Kio Primary (AMKP) School. &nbsp;&nbsp;We are united by a shared vision of “Every child, a Confident Person, a Joyful Learner and a Caring Citizen”.</p><p>I am thrilled to be writing to you today to introduce myself as the new Principal of Ang Mo Kio Primary (AMKP) School. It is an honour for me to join this extraordinary school community.</p><p>I would like to start by paying tribute to Mrs Lim Bee Lay’s steadfast stewardship of the school over the last three years. Bee Lay and the staff have done much to transform the school’s teaching and learning environment and programmes. I am committed to building on the good work, and I look forward to leading the school to new peaks of excellence.</p><p>Our school motto is “Rise and Shine”. “Rise” means to do one’s best as we strive for excellence and “Shine” connotes being a ray of light by showing care and providing guidance to others. Recently we chanced upon a good story of our pupils living out the school motto.</p><p>We learned that some of the pupils decided to step up on their own accord to play the role of ‘pupil counsellors’ to their peers. It happened ‘organically’ without being prompted by the teachers.&nbsp; What is especially heartening is that these ‘pupil counsellors’ are not our student leaders. They are just a group of pupils who thought that it was something worthwhile to do. Before each conversation, the ‘pupil counsellors’ would even ask their peers if they were looking for advice or just wanted someone to hear them out.&nbsp; A pupil leader who was involved in one such ‘counselling’ session shared that he appreciated it was an informal session which made him feel that he was speaking with a friend who could relate to his situation.</p><p>In this instance, we have a few pupils who decided to take charge when they saw that some of their classmates may require social-emotional support due to academic pressure, family or peer challenges.&nbsp; They exhibited “Rise” as they stepped up to offer a listening ear and “Shine” as they responded ‘instinctively’ to show care and support for their peers. This culture of care and personal excellence forms the core of the AMKP experience from the leaders to the staff and to the pupils.</p><p>It is my pleasure to invite you to explore the AMKP “Rise and Shine” experience via the school website. Thank you.</p><p>Yours truly</p><p>May Wong-Tan (Mrs)</p><p>Principal, AMKP</p>
