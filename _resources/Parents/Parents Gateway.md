**<font size="5">About</font>**

Parents Gateway is a mobile app developed by MOE to support parents’ involvement in their child/ward’s educational journey. The app enables you to receive information from the school and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for school programmes and activities, and declaring travel plans. 

We strongly encourage you to download Parents Gateway on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only). Upon successful download, the app will guide you through a simple one-time onboarding process. You may refer to the instructional guide below for more information.

For parents/ guardians who are unable to access Parents Gateway, please approach your child/ward’s form teachers for assistance.
