<p><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Leadership@AMKP - <em>Serving with Pride, Leading with Confidence</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>As part of our effort to grow the leader in all our AMKPians, students
are taught leadership skills which they hone as they practice the WISER
skillset. The skillset helps them develop a mindset we refer to as the
SAGE mindset. A tiered approach is adopted where Tier 1 includes all AMKPians
while Tier 2 includes class leaders who serve as subject champions and
Tier 3 student leaders serve as student councillors, peer support and CCA
leaders.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>For Tiers 2 and 3:</strong> AMKPians with leadership dispositions
and the passion for service are identified and given additional opportunities
in their various roles to hone their leadership. In the course of their
leadership journey at AMKP, the development of the skillset is deepened
as students progress from one level to the next.&nbsp; Students with leadership
roles are trained in the development of both the skillset and their functional
role during the two planned trainings annually.&nbsp; Platforms are provided
by the various departments and committees to give them the opportunities
to serve and enact their leadership within the school and community.</p>

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Our leadership experiences are guided by the three principles of ‘Voice
and Ownership, Empathy and Future-readiness’ and undergirded by the three
big ideas of Character and Citizenship Education (i.e., Identity, Relationships
and Choices). The school has focused on developing and deepening the experience
for all Tiers of leaders and assessing their growth.</p>

<p><strong>Partnering Others<u><br></u></strong>At <strong>ASPIRE</strong>,
we believe in learning beyond the classroom. Through partnerships with <strong>secondary school mentors</strong> and <strong>industry professionals</strong>,
we equip students with real-world skills to build confidence and increase
motivation.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Our peer mentorship programme connects our students with secondary school
role models while industry experts share valuable insights and hands-on
experiences to inspire them to achieve their goals. A highlight was our
collaboration with a hairstylist with 30+ years of experience, where students
learned self-grooming tips and received professional haircuts.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Special learning journeys are designed to inspire and create lasting
memories for our students. These experiences go beyond traditional learning,
offering opportunities to explore the world around them.</p>
<p>Past trips include visits to the <strong>Ang Mo Kio Fire Station</strong> and
the <strong>ArtScience Museum</strong>, where students engage with real-world
professionals. These learning journeys are carefully curated to spark curiosity,
encourage exploration, and deepen understanding of the world in fun and
memorable ways.</p>

<p><strong>Contribution to Our Community</strong>
</p>
<p>ASPIRE pupils also engage in community activities, such as the Ang Mo
Kio Town Council Creative Bin Project. Pupils painted public bins with
vibrant designs, turning an ordinary object into a creative expression
that beautifies shared spaces. This initiative helped to instill a sense
of ownership and civic pride in both the pupils and the community. Their
contributions encourage others to appreciate and care for their surroundings,
making the community a more welcoming place for everyone.</p>
