**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**
* Through the teaching and learning of reading, writing, speaking and listening components of English Language in AMKP, we hope to nurture confident communicators who enjoy **learning** and **using** English.


**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**

* To achieve this, the language learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* ACoLADE
		* Raising Awareness
		* Structuring Consolidation 
		* Facilitating Assessment for Learning 
		* Enabling Application
		* Guiding Discovery
		* Instructing Explicitly
* Learning Journeys 
* Shared Book approach (SBA)
* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) - A teaching approach that transitions students to eventually assume all the responsibility for their learning (self-directed learning).
* e-Pedagogy 
* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies 
* Differentiated Instruction (DI)
