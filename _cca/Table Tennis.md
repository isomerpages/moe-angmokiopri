**<font size=5>About</font>**

Our school team members train twice weekly to hone their skills in both offensive and defensive techniques. Every year, we participate in the zonal and national inter-schools competitions. Besides striving for excellence in competitions, we also place great emphasis in inculcating the school values such as care, respect, responsibility, integrity and resilience in our pupils.
