* The Modern Dance CCA aims to develop the students' interest in and appreciation of dance as they express themselves through movement. Through a wide range of dance genres such as hip hop and contemporary dances, we hope to nurture confident individuals who demonstrate our school values of responsibility, resilience and excellence while working collaboratively to achieve artistic goals as a team.
