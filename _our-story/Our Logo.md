&gt;OUR LOGO 


<img src="/images/About%20Us/40th%20Anniversary/Logo_nobackgrd.png" style="width:40%">


Our 40th&nbsp;Anniversary logo comprises three key&nbsp;features:

<u><b>F</b>ORTY-TUDE – OUR&nbsp;<b>F</b>ORTE</u>

Our theme, ‘Forty-tude’, signifies&nbsp;Forty&nbsp;years of stories, and our&nbsp;Fortitude&nbsp;\- the resilience and strength that all past, present, and future Amkpians embrace and will carry forward.

<u><b>F</b>AMILY – OUR DRIVING&nbsp;<b>F</b>ORCE</u>

Our family, our driving force at AMKP, is represented by the mosaic emblem designed by Ms Monica Leong, our Art teacher, by putting together photographs of AMKP staff, parents, and pupils.&nbsp; Our pupils remain as our core in all that we do, and joyful learning at AMKP is made possible by our staff, supported by our parents and our community.

<u><b>F</b>ORWARD LOOKING – OUR <b>F</b>UTURE</u>

The circular floral and laurel band symbolises our strength and victory. &nbsp;Our progress and achievements are made possible only with our strong foundation and foothold in values. &nbsp;Our strengths and fortitude in spirit will continue to lead us in caring, guiding, and inspiring more Amkpians to be forward-looking leaders of self and for others, with a passion for excellence, in preparation for our future.
