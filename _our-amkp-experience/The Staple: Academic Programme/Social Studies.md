<p>&gt;<strong>Social Studies</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Aim</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Through the teaching and learning of social studies in AMKP, we hope to
nurture informed, concerned, and participative citizens who understand

<p>To achieve this, the Social Studies learning experience in AMKP is made
“visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inquiry Approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance-based tasks (individual and group)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies</p>

<p><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Field-based learning through Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>Field-based learning through Learning Journeys allows the students to
contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting,
thus enabling the learning of concepts and content. Students are able to
conduct hands-on exploration in a focussed area of study, thus being engaged
in multi-sensory learning. As part of engaging students’ interest in inquiry,
field-based learning also motivates and sustains their interest in the
subject matter as they learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make
connections to the topic being studied.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Tasks</strong>
</p>
<p>Performance task is the mode of assessment that is adopted to best reflect
the students’ ability to translate and transfer key knowledge, skills and
values in a new context. The performance tasks allow students to apply
the knowledge, skills and values in a real-world context to showcase their
learning and understanding of the theme.</p>

<p><strong>Values-in-Action through Social Studies</strong>
</p>
<p>Values-in-Action (VIA) is a Key Student Development Experience (SDE) that
aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully
to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge
