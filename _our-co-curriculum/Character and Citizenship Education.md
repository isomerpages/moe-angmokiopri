**<font size="5">Key Programmes</font>**

**ALIVE Programme (AMKPS Leadership Inspired Values in Education)**<br>
In line with the school’s Strategic Thrust 1 in Engaging the Whole Child for Learning - Self Directed Learners and Morally Upright Citizens, the school Values are taught explicitly so as to develop each child to be independent learners and to have a good moral compass.  Through the ALIVE programme, we aim to achieve the School’s Vision of Every Child is a Leader of Self and for others with a passion for Excellence.

The ALIVE programme consists of the following programmes: Character Matters for Leaders lessons, Focus Group Discussions and the Young Leaders Forum.

* <u>Character Matters for Leaders</u> lessons are values-based lesson packages prepared by the CCE Department and have been revised to incorporate the teaching of the FTGP lessons as well as lessons on resilience. These lessons aim to develop the child’s potential holistically, intellectually, emotionally and socially.
* <u>Focus Group Discussions</u> will be held for selected group of pupils across various levels on a yearly basis.
* <u>The Young Leaders Forum</u> will focus on encouraging the Student Leaders from AMKPS and cluster schools to discuss and collaborate on the various issues for further cooperation that are relevant to them.

The objectives of the ALIVE are:

1. To teach the School Values explicitly to each child so as to inculcate these values in every child.
2. To guide each child to be able to apply these values in their daily lives and in their interaction with others.
3. To inculcate these values in each child so as to develop each child as a leader of self and for others.

**Values in Action Projects**

The Values in Action projects are learning experiences in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) that enhance the pupils’ development as socially responsible citizens. Through their contribution to the school and the community, the pupils develop their sense of commitment in playing their part to make Singapore a better place.

**MOE Sexuality Education in Schools (SEd)**

The goals of the MOE Sexuality Education (SEd) are:

* to help students understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature
* to develop healthy and rewarding relationships; and
* to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.

Sexuality Education covers the following dimensions of a person’s sexuality:

* **Physical**: Physical sexual maturation and intimacy, the physiology of sex and human reproduction;
* **Emotional**: Sexual attitudes and feelings towards self and others;
* **Social**: Sexual norms and behaviour and their legal, cultural and societal implications; and
* **Ethical**: Values and moral systems related to sexuality.

At Ang Mo Kio Primary School, the following lessons from the Growing Years Programme for Primary 5 and 6 pupils will be taught:
