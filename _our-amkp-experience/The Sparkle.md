* The Sparkle Programmes (our Learning for Life Programme and Applied Learning Programme) are uniquely AMKP school-based curriculum, developed to add “shine and sparkle” to the holistic development of our students in their six years of education.

* In lower primary years, our junior Confident AMKPians will learn to value integrity and be a responsible learner who will learn to discover their voice to express their thoughts, ideas and feelings and communicate confidently. They will learn good habits and learning dispositions to foster self-awareness and management.

* In middle primary years, our Confident AMKPians will learn to demonstrate respect and care for others. Their social and emotional competencies will be enhanced as they build empathy, social and cultural awareness and positive relationships with others through collaboration and working with others. They will also learn to strengthen their voice as they learn physical, linguistic, cognitive and social emotional skills in using their voice.

* In the upper primary years, our senior Confident AMKPians will learn to be courageous and resilient leaders with a passion for excellence. They will use their voice for service purposefully and confidently. They will be given opportunities to develop a growth mindset to make responsible decisions and overcome challenges to lead self and others to care for the community, cultivating civic literacy and global awareness.
