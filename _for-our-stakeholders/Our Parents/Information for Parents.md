**Photography and videography during school events**

Please note that photographs and videos of students, parents or guardians taken at school events by official school photographers may be published on the school’s official media platforms. These may be used for briefings, workshops and other educational purposes within MOE. Additionally, the school may publish photographs, videos and students’ work or achievements along with their names.
