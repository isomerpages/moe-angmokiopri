<p>Eligible families with Singapore Citizen children may apply for KiFAS
subsidy, which is provided by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA),
through MK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The family needs to meet either the Gross Monthly Household Income (HHI)
or the Gross Monthly Per Capita Income (PCI) criterion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child must attend at least one day of the kindergarten for the month
to qualify for the assistance, unless fully covered by a valid medical
certificate (MC) that states the period of absence from the centre for
the entire month (subject to ECDAâ€™s approval). Failure to do so will result
in the full kindergarten fee being payable for the month.</p>
