<p><strong>About</strong>
</p>
<p>The Scouts CCA strives to nurture our pupils into confident individuals
who are committed to service. Our Cub Scouts develop essential skills such
as First Aid, Outdoor Cooking, Track and Trail, Map Reading, Knotting,
and Foot Drills, while gaining valuable knowledge about their country and
community. Through participation in various events such as the South Area
Orienteering Competition, Job Week, National Day Commemoration, and national
camps, our Cub Scouts develop strong communication skills, teamwork, and
resilience.</p>
