<p><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Leadership@AMKP - <em>Serving with Pride, Leading with Confidence</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>

<p>As part of our effort to grow the leader in all our AMKPians, students
are taught leadership skills which they hone as they practise the WISER
skillset. The skillset helps them develop a mindset we refer to as the
SAGE mindset. A tiered approach is adopted where Tier 1 includes all AMKPians
while Tier 2 includes class leaders who serve as subject champions and
Tier 3 student leaders serve as student councillors, peer support and CCA
leaders.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>For Tiers 2 and 3:</strong> AMKPians with leadership dispositions
and the passion for service are identified and given additional opportunities
in their various roles to hone their leadership. In the course of their
leadership journey at AMKP, the development of the skillset is deepened
as students progress from one level to the next.&nbsp; Students with leadership
roles are trained in the development of both the skillset and their functional
role during the two planned trainings annually.&nbsp; Platforms are provided
by the various departments and committees to give them the opportunities
to serve and enact their leadership within the school and community.</p>

<p>Our leadership experiences are guided by the three principles of ‘Voice
and Ownership, Empathy and Future-readiness’ and undergirded by the three
big ideas of Character and Citizenship Education (i.e., Identity, Relationships
and Choices). The school has focused on developing and deepening the experience
for all Tiers of leaders and assessing their growth.</p>
