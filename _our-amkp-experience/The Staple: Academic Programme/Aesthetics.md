<p><strong>Our Aim</strong>
</p>
<p>Every child, experiencing the wonder of art and music, uncovers their
creative spark and flourishes into a confident, expressive individual,
enriching the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>We embrace the 4E framework to deliver meaningful aesthetic experiences
for every AMKPian: <strong>Expose</strong>, <strong>Enrich</strong>, <strong>Empower</strong>, <strong>Elevate</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Expose</strong>
</p>
<p>Through our comprehensive six-year journey at AMKP, students embark on
an enriching exploration of diverse artistic and musical expressions. Our
curriculum spans a wide range of art forms, from traditional mediums to
digital platforms, nurturing creativity and cultural appreciation. By integrating
educational technology and new media into our programmes, we create engaging,
relevant learning experiences that develop e-21st century competencies
and prepare our students for the future.</p>
