<p><strong>Mother Tongue Languages</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Aim</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At AMKP, the Mother Tongue Language teachers seek to nurture joyful learners,
confident users of the Mother Tongue Language and cultural inheritors who
appreciate their unique identity and culture.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Approach</u></strong>
<br><strong>Joyful Learners</strong>
<br>Learning of Mother Tongue Languages is made enjoyable through role-play,
collaborative tasks, interactive games and the use of Edtech tools. Students
experience the joy in learning Mother Tongue Languages as we make the experiences
authentic and relevant to them.
<br>
<br><strong>Confident users of Mother Tongue Languages</strong>
<br>In AMKP, we build up students’ confidence in using their Mother Tongue
Language through the use of differentiated teaching approaches. Various
opportunities are created for our students to express themselves in their
Mother Tongue Language, as we believe that frequent use of the language
will result in increased confidence.
<br>
<br><strong> Cultural inheritors</strong>
<br>Our students are exposed to a variety of cultural activities as they engage
in hands-on sessions to create traditional crafts, view cultural performances
and immerse themselves in the festivities during the celebration of Chinese
New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali. Through these experiences, students
can better understand and appreciate their unique identity and culture.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Key Programmes</u></strong>
</p>

<p>Reading Programme</p>
<p>Reading is instrumental to development of language competency. At AMKP,
the MTL reading programme includes the setting up of reading corners in
the classroom with interesting and age-appropriate story books, organisation
of activities that promote the love for reading which includes student
book reviews and reading portfolios.</p>
<p>In 2025, AMKP rolled out the MTL SOAR programme, designed to <strong>S</strong>park
interest,<strong> O</strong>pen minds, enabling students to <strong>A</strong>ppreciate
cultural heritage, and <strong>R</strong>ise as confident readers. 30 minutes
of the weekly curriculum time is ring-fenced for teachers to engage students
with age-appropriate texts, creating meaningful opportunities to explore
various stories with the aim of developing students’ interest in reading,
and at the same time nurture the emerging 21st-century competencies such
as civic literacy, communication and critical thinking.</p>
<p>AMKP also establishes partnership with parents by inviting them to conduct
storytelling sessions for the Lower Primary students.</p>
