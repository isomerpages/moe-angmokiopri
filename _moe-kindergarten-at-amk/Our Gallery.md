<p>This year’s Hari Raya celebration embraced the theme “Riang Ria Raya”,
meaning <em>The Joyous Celebration of Hari Raya</em>. The celebration offered
a meaningful glimpse into Hari Raya traditions through interactive sharing,
lively performances by our K1 and K2 Malay children, and hands-on craft
activities. Children were invited to come dressed in their traditional
Malay costumes or home clothes, adding colour and charm to the celebration.
A highlight of the day was the delightful catwalk segment, where the children
proudly showcased their festive outfits with smiles and confidence. It
was truly a joyous occasion for all!</p>

<p>The Kindergarten 2 (K2) children had an enriching and fun learning journey
to the KidsStop@Science Centre. They were engaged in hands-on activities
during the ‘My Healthy Kitchen’ guided programme. They learnt about the
importance of good nutrition, drinking sufficient water and the benefits
of exercising to keep themselves healthy. We also had the opportunity to
explore the various exhibits at KidsStop. These included choosing healthy
food, fruits and vegetables at the supermarket pretend play area as well
as learning more about what their bodies can do at the ‘My Wonderful Body’
exhibit. The children had a blast!</p>

<p>On 28 January 2025, MK children and staff joined the students and teachers
of AMKP for the Chinese New Year celebration. We had so much fun and laughter
as we gathered to celebrate and usher in the Year of the Snake. The children
were dressed beautifully in their Chinese traditional costumes and/or home
clothes! They were exuberant and excited to watch the lion dance performance
and sing-along session. The children also had the opportunity to have hands-on
experiences to perform as lion dancers as well as creating their own snake
craft in class! The K2 Chinese children also got to experience Chinese
calligraphy as they got to practise writing Chinese New Year auspicious
greetings and presenting it to the school leaders! We had a whale of a
time!</p>
