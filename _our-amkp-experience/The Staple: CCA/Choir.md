**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Choir CCA is an exciting new co-curricular activity (CCA) offered at AMK primary school, aimed at nurturing students' musical talents and fostering a love for singing. Through the power of voice, this CCA is designed to instil discipline, teamwork, and a deep appreciation for music in our young learners.
