<p>&gt;<strong>Co-Curriculum Activities</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Aim</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At AMKP, we believe in holistic education that grows a child as a whole
and co-curricular activities (CCAs) form an integral part of an all-round
education for our students. Through active participation in CCAs, we hope
that AMKPians will discover their interests and talents, develop their
character, learn values, social emotional competencies and other relevant
skills to prepare them for future challenges. By learning and interacting
with one another in CCAs, we hope that students will develop friendships
and deepen their sense of belonging to their CCA, AMKP and community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>100% CCA participation: Every student from P3 onwards is required to participate
in one CCA during his/her primary school years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catering to diverse needs of our students: AMKP offers a total of 14 CCAs
classified under four clusters (Clubs and Societies, Physical Sports, Uniformed
Groups, and Visual and Performing Arts) to cater to the different strengths,
talents and interests of our students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Choice CCA: AMKPians will be offered their first choice CCAs without
any trials/auditions so that students are given an opportunity to pursue
their interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recreational CCAs: P3 to P6 students are encouraged to join recreational
CCAs to discover, pursue and develop their interest and/or talent as they
learn skills at a beginning level and/or improve on them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
