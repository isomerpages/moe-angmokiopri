&gt;**Physical Education**

**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**

* Through the teaching and learning of physical education in AMKP, we hope to develop in students the knowledge (Head), attitude (Heart) and skills (Hand) to pursue and enjoy a physically active and healthy lifestyle and enable them to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**
* To achieve this, the physical education learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* Direct Instruction and Demonstration
	* Movement Education
	* Games Concept Approach (GCA)
	* Sport Education
	* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) - A teaching approach that transitions students to eventually assume all the responsibility for their learning (self-directed learning).
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies 
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI) 

**<font size="5">Our Key Programmes</font>**
1. Physical Education @ AMKP (P1-P6) 
* The PE programme includes 7 learning areas such as Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Athletics (starts at P3), Physical Health and Fitness, and Swimming (completed by Primary 6). 
* The school provides various platforms for the students to apply their sports skills learnt and these include:
	* Lower Primary Games Day (P1-P2)
	* Sports Carnival (P3-P6)
	* P3 and P4 Sports Education Programme
	* P5 Camp Resilience
	* P6 Swimsafer Programme
	* P5 and P6 Inter-class Games
	* Unstructured Recess Play

2. Programme for Active Learning (PAL) – Sports &amp; Games and Outdoor Education Modules (P1-P2) 

* The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 students offering active, hands-on and meaningful learning experiences for our lower primary students. 
* The Sports and Games Modules for Primary 1 and 2 students allow students to be engaged in a variety of sports and games activities, e.g. fundamental movement, movement exploration, creative movement and modified sports and games. This engagement promotes interactions among the students and enable them to develop their interpersonal and social skills, attitudes and values in a sports context.
* The Outdoor Education Modules for Primary 1 and 2 students expose them to the NParks Kids for Nature Programme. P1 students learn to appreciate outdoor setting and realise that there are many things to be discovered such as nature, clouds, sun and wind, which cannot be found indoors. P2 students learn to orientate themselves in school using pictorial map/directions and appreciate nature and Singapore’s rich biodiversity through the study of trees.

3.  Kids Got Voice (P1-P6)
* Believing in student voice, the Kids Got Voice provides a platform for students to showcase their interests and talents in sports (as well as music, drama and art).
