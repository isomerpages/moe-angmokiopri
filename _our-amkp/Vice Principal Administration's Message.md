<p><em>"Education is not just about preparing students for the next exam, job, or stage of life. It is about preparing them to learn for life, to adapt to change, and to contribute meaningfully to society." – </em>Mr
Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education</p>
<p></p>
<p>Education is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is about nurturing
every child to be a lifelong learner, ready to navigate the challenges
of an ever-changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At Ang Mo Kio Primary School, our mission is guided by clear student outcomes:
to nurture confident individuals, joyful learners, and caring citizens
who are prepared to contribute meaningfully to society.&nbsp; I firmly
believe that no one is too young to make a difference, whether within their
family, school, or community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To this end, our school provides a wide array of opportunities beyond
the classroom, empowering students to grow holistically. They learn to
care for themselves, practise acts of kindness, and engage meaningfully
with others both in and outside of school.&nbsp; It is heartening to see
our students grow as they go about guiding new Primary 1 students to their
classrooms, planning Values-In-Action programmes to engage residents in
the Ang Mo Kio estate, confidently sharing Tamil culture with members of
the public at the Mother Tongue Languages Symposium, unleashing their creativity
by collaborating with teachers and a local artist to co-create the “Deforestation”
mural along our classroom block. These experiences embody the learning
and growth we aspire for them to achieve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This, however, cannot be accomplished by the school alone. I believe that
education is a collaborative effort that thrives on strong partnerships
between parents, educators, and the wider school community. Together with
our Parent Support Group, we strive to create a nurturing environment where
every child feels supported, inspired, and empowered to explore their potential.
By working hand in hand, we establish the structures and processes necessary
to provide holistic support for all our students, empowering them to navigate
the challenges of an ever-changing world.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong>
</p>
<p>Ms Alethea Liew
<br>Vice-Principal Administration</p>
