&gt;**Principal's Message**

<p align="justify">On behalf of the school, I would like to wish everyone a happy and meaningful 2023! To all our existing students, a warm welcome back, and to our new students – P1 and our second batch of MOE Kindergarten (MK) students, we welcome you to our AMKPian family. We look forward to an exciting year of learning and growing as a community. <br><br>

In 2022, we returned to normalcy in stages and learnt to live with COVID-19. Despite the challenges posed by the situation, AMKP remains committed to ensuring that our students’ learning and development is not unduly compromised. I am indeed proud to be part of this community of students, parents, teachers and admin/support staff, all of whom are united in a desire to provide the very best and safe environment for our children amidst the ongoing pandemic. <br><br>

The primary school years are an exciting time when children embark upon new adventures in the world of learning.  Each year will provide important transitions and the acquisition of new skills that will enhance each student’s ability to apply learning in many ways.  I believe that all children can learn and be successful, and that they learn best when they are connected, cared for, and cherished. AMKP is committed to providing a challenging and rigorous curriculum that helps each student progress at a developmentally appropriate pace within a safe and inclusive learning community for all students.  We aim to inculcate in each child, our school R<sup>3</sup>IC<sup>2</sup>E (<i>Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Care, Courage and Excellence</i>) values, dispositions, knowledge and skills to face unknown situations with confidence as they learn for life. Specifically, we believe that our students can be self-directed learners with an optimistic outlook, confident communicators, effective team players and responsible citizens.<br><br>

The pandemic has taught us many lessons, including the importance of developing self-motivated individuals who care not just about themselves, but are passionate to connect with others and issues, and with confidence, actively contribute to the good of others and society. The health crisis has, in fact, presented us an opportunity to emerge stronger and our students have become more skillful in harnessing the strengths of technology to develop future ready skills. As a school, we are committed to developing every AMKPian to be a ‘Confident Person, a Joyful Learner and a Caring Citizen’, with the courage to pursue his or her aspirations. We are heartened that our common identity has resonated strongly with students, staff, parents and stakeholders. As we move into our next phase of growth, we will be strengthening existing structures to help our students deepen their joy for learning through positive education, as well as continue in building a positive school culture that cares and supports for one another, encourages strong relationships between students and teachers, and works towards continual improvement for personal excellence.  <br><br>

I am a firm believer that it takes a village to raise a child. Student success is therefore attributed to the strong partnerships and relationships we build between the home and school as well as within our community. I look forward to working with our parents, community partners and stakeholders as we strive to provide a conducive environment where learning is delightful and children find joy in coming to school - AMKP where our students R<sup>3</sup>IC<sup>2</sup>E and Shine!
