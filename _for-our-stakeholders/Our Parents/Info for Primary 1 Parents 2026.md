talk is scheduled from 10.30am to 11.30am in the School Hall. This valuable

strategies to support your child's academic, social and emotional well-being,
identifying signs of struggles with transition, and self-care tips for
navigating this phase. We strongly encourage you to register for this talk

day of formal education - and your presence would make it even more meaningful
for them.</p>
