&gt;**Music**

**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**
* Through the teaching and learning of music in AMKP, we hope to develop in our students an awareness and appreciation for music in local and global cultures and ability for creative expression and communication through music while providing the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music.

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**
* To achieve this, the music learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* Experience-Concept-Application (ECA) Approach 
	* ICT-enabled music learning 
	* Collaborative music making 
	* Kodaly (performing, singing, instrumental learning, creating, listening, critical thinking and musical literacy) 
	* Dalcroze Eurhythmics (music learning involving movement of all parts of the body to enhance co-ordination, concentration and the ability to feel music with the whole body) 
	* Orff Schulwerk (focusing on creative music making through “play”, singing, chanting rhymes, clapping, dancing, and keeping a beat on anything near at hand)
	* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) - A teaching approach that transitions students to eventually assume all the responsibility for their learning (self-directed learning).
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies 
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI)

**<font size="5">Our Key Programmes</font>**
1. Music Experience Modules (P1-P6) 
* Guided by the Experience-Concept-Application (ECA) Approach, our Music Experience Modules for six years include: Handbells (Coloured Bells) for P1, Percussion Stomp for P2, Garage Band for P3, Music Composition for P4, Ukulele for P5 and Hiphop and Cajon for P6. 

2. Programme for Active Learning (PAL) – Music Module (P1-P2) 
* The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 students offering active, hands-on and meaningful learning experiences for our lower primary students. The Musical Adventure Module for Primary 1 students allows them to respond to music through body movements and create musical instruments using daily objects. The Music Learning Journey Module for Primary 2 students expose them to rhythm, chanting of rhymes, creating soundscapes and conducting music.

3. Kids Got Voice @ Recess (P1-P6) 
* Believing in student voice, the Kids Got Voice provides a platform for students to showcase their interests and talents in music (as well as art, drama and PE). 

4. Music Learning Journey (P3) 
* The Music Learning Journey to Esplanade provides our P3 students an opportunity to watch a musical performances at Esplanade and have a guided tour of the theatre.
