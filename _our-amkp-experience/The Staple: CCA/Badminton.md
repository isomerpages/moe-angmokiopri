**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Badminton CCA aims to bring joy to our students as they learn to play the game for recreation or as a competitive sport&nbsp;. Through acquiring the fundamental skills of using different strokes, proper serving form and footwork, our students will be able to develop confidence in themselves as they progress from training to competition mode. &nbsp;
