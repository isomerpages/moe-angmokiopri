**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Infocomm Technology (Computing) aims to ignite studentsâ€™ interest in ICT in a&nbsp; fun and meaningful way and learn skills such as the use of digital media and mobile technologies. Through these audio-visual training sessions, our students will be able to apply their learning as they provide support in our school events such as flag raising ceremony and assembly talks.
