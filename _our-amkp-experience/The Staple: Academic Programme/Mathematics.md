<p><strong>Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Aim</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At AMKP, our Mathematics teaching and learning approach is designed to
foster joyful learners, confident problem-solvers, and caring citizens
by making mathematics engaging, meaningful, and relevant to everyday life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Joyful Learners</strong>: We create a positive and stimulating
learning environment where students experience the joy of discovery through <strong>purposeful play</strong>,
interactive lessons, and real-world applications. By incorporating games,
puzzles, and collaborative problem-solving, we aim to make learning mathematics
an enjoyable and fulfilling journey.</p>

<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confident Persons</strong>: We build students' confidence by fostering
a growth mindset, encouraging them to tackle challenges, persist through
obstacles, and learn from their mistakes. Through the school-wide thinking
routine <strong>‘UnPAC!’ (Understand, Plan, Act, and Check)</strong>, we
equip them with essential metacognitive and problem-solving skills, enabling
them to approach mathematical tasks with confidence and resilience. Additionally,
we create opportunities for students to present their ideas, helping them
further develop their self-assurance.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Caring Citizens</strong>: Beyond academic excellence, we emphasize
the role of mathematics in fostering social responsibility and empathy.
Through real-world problem-solving tasks, <strong>Mathematics Journalling</strong> and
discussions using data and statistics, students learn to apply mathematical
thinking to contribute positively to society.</p>

<p>By integrating these values into our Mathematics curriculum, we ensure
that students not only excel academically but also develop essential life
skills that prepare them for future success and responsible citizenship.</p>

<p><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Math Fi.e.s.t.a (P1 - P6)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Math <strong>Fi.e.s.t.a</strong> (<strong><em>FI</em></strong>nancial literacy, <strong><em>E</em></strong>xploration, <strong><em>S</em></strong>cience, <strong><em>T</em></strong>echnology, <strong><em>A</em></strong>ppreciation)
is AMKP’s refreshed and distinctive mathematics programme, that provides
students with rich learning experiences within and beyond the classroom,
to ignite the joy of learning mathematics, and make learning visible, inclusive
and authentic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme (P1-P4)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This specialised early intervention programme conducted by LSM-trained
teachers helps students who need additional help with Mathematics to develop
basic numeracy skills. Students are identified to attend this programme
through screening conducted upon school entry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme (P4-P5) and Mathematics Olympiad
(P4-P6)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Conducted by school teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy,
this programme aims to develop the mathematical reasoning skills of High
Progress Learners in Mathematics and deepen their conceptual understanding
through an inquiry approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mathematics Olympiad programme nurtures young problem solvers by challenging
them to think critically, sharpen their analytical skills, and explore
concepts beyond the standard curriculum. Through the engaging training
sessions, students develop essential 21st-century competencies such as
critical thinking, inventive thinking, and effective communication. Each
year, our Maths Olympiad students represent the school in local and international
competitions. In 2024, our students achieved outstanding results—3 Gold,
4 Silver, 7 Bronze, and 21 Honourable Mentions in the SASMO, NMOS, and
the Visual-Spatial Mathlympics.</p>
