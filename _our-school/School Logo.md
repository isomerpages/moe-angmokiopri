This design takes the concept of the flaming desire to achieve the best and to aspire.

<br>  <br> 

The three twirls represent the cognitive, physical, and moral development of our students.

<br>   <br> 

The upward movement of the twirls signifies the aspiration to aspire and&nbsp;all-round education represented&nbsp;by the sphere.

<br>   <br> 

The circular band symbolises the collaborative efforts between the school and the community to inspire our students in their pursuit of excellence.

<br>   <br> 

Collectively, these culminate in an individual who is able to contribute to society and meet the challenges of an ever-changing world.
