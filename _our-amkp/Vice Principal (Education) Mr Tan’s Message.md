<p>I believe education is about helping students discover who they are and
who they can become, giving them hope, confidence, and the skills to face
the future. In a nurturing school environment, students should feel safe
to learn, make mistakes, and grow. As Jess Lair wisely said, “Children
are not things to be moulded, but people to be unfolded.” This reminds
us that every child has unique strengths and potential waiting to be developed.</p>
<p>By recognising each student’s strengths and areas for growth, we can help
build their confidence and self-belief. When students are encouraged to
think independently, express themselves, and remain curious about their
surroundings, they begin to trust their own voices. Confidence grows when
effort is valued, challenges are seen as opportunities, and mistakes are
treated as part of the learning journey.</p>
<p>Education is also essential for character building. Through cooperation,
sharing, and caring for others, students develop empathy and responsibility.
Ultimately, education gives hope by nurturing confident, compassionate
individuals who are prepared to face the future with optimism and purpose.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with the AMKP teachers and staff to support
every student in their learning journey. Together, we can create a school
environment where students feel encouraged, valued, and inspired to reach
their full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholas Tan</p>
<p>Vice-Principal</p>
