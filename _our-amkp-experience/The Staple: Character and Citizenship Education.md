<p>&gt;<strong>Character and Citizenship Education @ AMKP</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Our Aim</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At AMKP, our CCE programme nurtures every student to become a <strong>Confident Person</strong> with
a strong moral compass and effective socio-emotional skills, a <strong>Joyful Learner</strong> equipped
with 21st Century Competencies, and a <strong>Caring Citizen</strong> who
contributes meaningfully to the community and nation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We achieve this through:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Intentionality</strong>
</p>
<p>We design and implement learning experiences in the classroom and other
student development experiences with clear intended outcomes that weave
together values education, social-emotional learning, and 21st Century
Competencies.</p>
<p>We adopt age-appropriate pedagogical approaches to engage students both
cognitively and affectively to ensure meaningful and purposeful learning.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student-Centric Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>We tailor CCE learning experiences to students' needs and interests, promoting
student voice and active engagement in both cognitive and affective domains
to help them derive personal meaning from these experiences.</p>
<p>This is supported by a caring and enabling school environment built on
strong teacher-student relationships (TSR), peer support and relationships
(PSR), positive adult role-modelling, and student voice and ownership,
nurturing both character growth and future-ready capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coherent Implementation</strong>
</p>
<p>We implement CCE across the total curriculum through a whole-school approach,
developing students progressively through clear developmental milestones
in character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>In AMKP, CCE is enacted based on the belief of ‘<strong>Every School Experience a CCE Lesson’</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>curriculum content of CCE</strong> is based on the three big
ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It involves the teaching
and learning of core values and social-emotional competencies with a focus
on developing a sense of purpose in our students. These fundamentals are
taught and applied in the six curriculum content areas of CCE – National
Education (NE), Sexuality Education, Mental Health, Education and Career
Guidance, Cyber Wellness, Family Education.</p>
<p></p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Periods) (P1-P6)</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At AMKP, Form Teachers enhance students’ voice, ownership, and sense-making
in their socio-emotional learning through skilful facilitation strategies.
We train our P3-P6 CCE Champions (Tier 2 Student Leaders) to support teachers
in facilitating lessons and engage peers in the discussion of current affairs.</p>

<p>During <strong>‘Bonding Over Breakfast’</strong>, students present cards
to their friends as a gesture of appreciation, expressing gratitude and
words of thanks to one another. Other interaction activities during lessons
also help to develop social skills and foster peer support and bonding
among students.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>CCE (Mother Tongue Languages) (P1-P6)</strong>
</p>
<p>CCE (Mother Tongue Languages) forms part of the explicit teaching and
learning of moral values, by using cultural stories, practices, songs,
idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language. Students explore
how values are lived in the past in our communities and the relevance of
these values to our lives and today’s context. For students who offer the
non-Tamil Indian Languages or are exempted from taking MTL, lessons will
be taught in English. <strong>Link to <a href="https://www.angmokiopri.moe.edu.sg/our-amkp-experience/the-staple-academic-programme/mother-tongue-languages/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AMKP MTL</a></strong>

<p><strong>PAL (Programme for Active Learning) (P1-P2)</strong>
</p>
<p>PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 students.
PAL offers learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful.
PAL contributes to the development of soft skills in our students such
as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others. The programme
encourages students to have a lively curiosity about the world they live
in and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge. <strong>Link to <a href="https://www.angmokiopri.moe.edu.sg/our-amkp-experience/our-curriculum/physical-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AMKP PAL</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In particular, our Primary 4 students have been making remarkable strides
in environmental advocacy through their VIA project, "AMKP Cares for the
Environment," guided by the inspiring slogan "AMKP: Little Steps, Green
Future!"</p>
<p>During BBC Week in Term 2, our P4 students first shared their comprehensive
Plant Care Guides with Primary 2 students, fostering environmental awareness
amongst younger pupils and creating a culture of sustainability within
our school community.</p>
<p>The project reached new heights on 2 September when selected P4 iPW groups
presented their Plant Care Guides to the public, demonstrating deep knowledge
on nurturing different plant species. Following these informative presentations,
our P4 Science Champions conducted engaging workshops, teaching community
members to construct mini-gardens using recycled materials.</p>
<p>The day concluded meaningfully as members of the public wrote personal
pledges outlining their commitment to building a greener environment. This
initiative beautifully demonstrates how our young environmental advocates
are creating positive ripple effects, inspiring both peers and the wider
community to embrace sustainable practices for our planet’s future.</p>

<p><strong>Sexuality Education</strong>
</p>
<p>At Primary 5 and 6, specially-trained teachers guide our students in understanding
and managing the various changes and challenges they face at the onset
of puberty. Topics include the changes involved in puberty, building healthy
relationships and the importance of family, attitudes and values towards
physical intimacy. <strong>Link to <a href="https://www.angmokiopri.moe.edu.sg/our-amkp-experience/the-staple-sexuality-education/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AMKP Sexuality Education</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness in CCE focusses on the well-being of our students as they
navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge
and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain
a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of
ICT. <strong>Link to <a href="https://www.angmokiopri.moe.edu.sg/information-and-communication-technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AMKP ICT</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Family Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Family Education focusses on the teaching and learning of&nbsp;skills
to strengthen relationships. This will nurture&nbsp;confidence&nbsp;and
seed&nbsp;positive experiences&nbsp;for a longer-term perspective of the
value of families, which provides the foundation for the building of communities
and developing the&nbsp;resilience&nbsp;of our people for the flourishing
of the nation.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental Health</strong>
</p>
<p>Mental Health Education is one of the key features of the CCE curriculum.
Through these lessons, students are equipped with knowledge and skills
to build their resilience, strengthen their mental well-being and resolve
their challenges. For example, students learn to differentiate normal stress
from distress and mental illness. They learn to break negative thinking
patterns, overcome social emotional problems and seek help when they need
to. Students are also taught to stand up against stigma around mental health
issues.</p>
