**<font size="5">Learning Outcomes</font>**

To inculcate in pupils a passion for exploring science through inquiry and experiential learning.

**<font size="5">Teaching Approaches</font>**

Our Science curriculum is anchored on teaching and learning through inquiry. Ang Mo Kio Primary School adopts the pedagogy of Inquiry-based in the teaching and learning of Science. The 5E Instructional Model is the pillar in the design of the lesson. We create opportunities for the pupils in order to stimulate their curiosity, drive their passion and engage them cognitively. Pupils get to explore within and outside the confines of the classroom.  

**<font size="5">Key Programmes</font>**

**Science Learning Journeys**
* To provide pupils with experiences which build on their interest and to stimulate their curiosity to learn more about Science
* To provide pupils with Science concepts to help them understand the world around them
* To provide pupils with opportunities to develop process skills and adopt mental attitudes that are important in scientific inquiry

Singapore Science Centre, ZOO and Butterfly Park are some of the places pupils go, to experience learning outside school.  Learning journeys serve as alternative avenues to provide the authentic and vibrant experiences for pupils to construct meaning from Scientific phenomena they observed and be engaged in. Pupils investigate and make connections of what they already know to what they learn during these learning journeys.  After the learning journey, they carry on with research or de-brief activities to further enhance their understanding.

**Hydroponics Programme**

* To provide pupils with experiences which build on their interest and to stimulate their curiosity to learn more about Science
* To provide pupils with Science concepts to help them understand the world around them
* To provide pupils with opportunities to develop process skills and adopt mental attitudes that are important in scientific inquiry

P4 pupils embark on the Hydroponics Programme which aims to allow pupils to gain a deeper insight into urban farming through experiential learning.

During the programme, pupils have first-hand experience in growing green leafy vegetables using the Dynamic Root Floating Technique (DRF). Pupils also learnt the technique of seeding, maintenance of the nutrients supply and the process of harvesting.

**Science Note-Booking**

Note-booking encourages and enhances pupils’ natural curiosity and motivation for learning and connect science to their everyday life. This helps pupils to develop a deeper understanding of science.

The Science notebooks are also an excellent tool for pupils to communicate their understanding of science concepts, for teachers to provide pupils with feedback, and, finally to assess pupils (Shepardson & Britsch, 2000, 2001)

**<font size="5">Note to Parents</font>**

The learning of Science should not be restricted to the textbook or workbook. Let’s encourage our children to look beyond curriculum resources. In your daily interactions with them, seize “teaching moments” at home and link scientific concepts to activities that they do at home. Indeed, Science is Everywhere.
