**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Red Cross Youth CCA is committed to promoting values such as compassion, passion, and professionalism in all our members. Our Red Cross Links engage in a range of enriching activities, including first aid training, foot drills, and service education. Beyond school-based events, our Links also participate in a variety of programmes and competitions organised by Red Cross Youth, such as the First Aid Championship (FAC), Disaster and Risk Reduction Championship (DRRC), Ambassadors of Blood Championship (ABC), Linkamania Camp, World Red Cross Day, and Grateful Hearts. Through these diverse and engaging activities, our Links develop adaptability, resilience, and confidence as collaborative team players.
