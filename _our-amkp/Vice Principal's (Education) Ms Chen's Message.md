<p>I believe a school is a place of hope, love, and possibilities whereby
students are motivated to embrace learning, take risks, and believe in
their abilities. I draw inspiration from the timeless wisdom encapsulated
in the words: 'There are but two lasting bequests we can hope to give our
children. One of these is roots, the other, wings.' The model below is
a visual representation of my educational beliefs and vision of how learning
looks like for our students. The student in the middle is grounded in her
base of core knowledge, cultural understanding, and ethical values. She
is guided by her moral compass as she navigates her flight into the future.
She is accompanied by another student who represents the will to act and
courage to step out of his comfort zone. He develops critical thinking
skills and learn to appreciate diversity through the different creative
lenses in his learning environment.</p>

<p>For me, education is not merely about imparting knowledge, but about cultivating
a strong foundation while encouraging personal growth so our students become
well-rounded individuals who are both firmly grounded and capable of reaching
great heights.</p>
<p>It is my privilege to serve with my teachers in AMKP as we partner you
in your childâ€™s journey with us. I look forward to your continued support
to cultivate a community where our students can develop confidence, feel
supported, and be encouraged to explore their potential.</p>

<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong>
