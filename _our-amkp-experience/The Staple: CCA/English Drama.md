* The English Drama CCA aims to develop confident and expressive individuals who appreciates the performing arts through exposure, experience and involvement in drama. While learning to appreciate a variety of theatre performances of different styles (e.g. Puppetry),&nbsp; we hope that students will develop social and emotional competencies and work collaboratively to achieve common artistic goals while performing on stage.
