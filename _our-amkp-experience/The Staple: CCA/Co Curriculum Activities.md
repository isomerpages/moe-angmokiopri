&gt;**Co-Curriculum Activities**

**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**
* At AMKP, we believe in holistic education that grows a child as a whole and co-curricular activities (CCAs) form an integral part of an all-round education for our students. Through active participation in CCAs, we hope that AMKPians will discover their interests and talents, develop their character, learn values, social emotional competencies and other relevant skills to prepare them for future challenges. By learning and interacting with one another in CCAs, we hope that students will develop friendships and deepen their sense of belonging to their CCA, AMKP and community.

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**
* 100% CCA participation: Every student from P3 onwards is required to participate in one CCA during his/her primary school years. 
* Catering to diverse needs of our students: AMKP offers a total of 14 CCAs classified under four clusters (Clubs and Societies, Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups, and Visual and Performing Arts) to cater to the different strengths, talents and interests of our students.
* First Choice CCA: AMKPians will be offered their first choice CCAs without any trials/auditions so that students are given an opportunity to pursue their interests. 
* Recreational CCAs:  P3 to P6 students are encouraged to join recreational CCAs to discover, pursue and develop their interest and/or talent as they learn skills at a beginning level and/or improve on them.
