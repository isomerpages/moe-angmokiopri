<p>&gt;<strong>Social Studies</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Our Aim</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Through the teaching and learning of social studies in AMKP, we hope to
nurture informed, concerned, and participative citizens who understand
the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world we live in and appreciate
the complexities of the human experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To achieve this, the Social Studies learning experience in AMKP is made
“visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inquiry Approach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance-based tasks (individual and group)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiated Instruction (DI)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Field-based learning through Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Field-based learning through Learning Journeys allows the students to
contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting,
thus enabling the learning of concepts and content. Students are able to
conduct hands-on exploration in a focussed area of study, thus being engaged
in multi-sensory learning. As part of engaging students’ interest in inquiry,
field-based learning also motivates and sustains their interest in the
subject matter as they learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make
connections to the topic being studied.</p>

<p><strong>Performance Tasks</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Performance task is the mode of assessment that is adopted to best reflect
the students’ ability to translate and transfer key knowledge, skills and
values in a new context. The performance tasks allow students to apply
the knowledge, skills and values in a real-world context to showcase their
learning and understanding of the theme.</p>
