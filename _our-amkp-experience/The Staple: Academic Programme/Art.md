**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**
* Through the teaching and learning of art in AMKP, we hope to nurture students who enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture.

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**
* To achieve this, the art learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* 4Es Approach (Experience, Exposure, Expression and Enrichment)
	* Inquiry-based Learning
	* Facilitating Collaborative Learning in Art
	* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) - A teaching approach that transitions students to eventually assume all the responsibility for their learning (self-directed learning).
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI)
