<p><strong>A warm welcome back to all our students and families and wishing everyone a meaningful and energising start to 2026.</strong>
</p>
<p>As we begin the new school year at Ang Mo Kio Primary School, I would
like to thank our students, parents, and staff for your continued trust,
support, and partnership. Together, we strive to create a caring and inclusive
environment where every child feels safe, valued, and encouraged to grow
in both learning and character.</p>
<p>As we <em>Start Right</em> in 2026, our focus is on strengthening the foundations
that support our students’ holistic development. We will continue to <strong>enhance the quality of teaching and learning</strong> by
providing engaging, purposeful, and meaningful learning experiences that
support every child’s progress. At the same time, we remain committed to <strong>strengthening character grounding and interpersonal skills</strong>,
helping our students develop positive values, self-discipline, resilience,
and respect for others.</p>
<p>We will also provide more <strong>platforms for students to discover and develop their interests and passions</strong>,
allowing them to experience joy in learning and build confidence in their
abilities. In addition, we will continue <strong>reimagining our learning spaces</strong> so
that classrooms and shared areas support collaboration, creativity, and
a strong sense of belonging for all students.</p>
<p>Strong relationships remain central to our work. Through positive friendships,
caring teacher-student relationships, and close partnerships with parents,
we aim to create a safe, respectful, and supportive school environment
where every child can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally.</p>
<p>To our students who are new to Ang Mo Kio Primary, a very warm welcome.
We are glad you are part of our school family, and we hope you will soon
feel the care, support, and joy of learning that define our school.</p>
<p>As we journey through 2026, let us work together to build strong foundations
for our students—academically, socially, and emotionally—so that every
child can thrive and grow to their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Let us continue to <strong>Rise and Shine as one strong AMKP family in 2026.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>Mr. Muhammad Farizal
<br>Principal</p>
