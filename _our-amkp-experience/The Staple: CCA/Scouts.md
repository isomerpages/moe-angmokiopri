* Scouts CCA focusses on encouraging the students to be selfless individuals who are always willing to serve others and the community. Through a wide range of activities planned such as community service to the residents in the Ang Mo Kio neighbourhood, camp and team bonding games, our students will be learning important values such as showing care and respect for others.
