&gt;Mother Tongue Languages

**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>** 
* Through the teaching and learning of reading, writing, speaking and listening components of Mother Tongue Languages in AMKP, we hope to nurture active learners and proficient users of Mother Tongue Languages with an understanding of their unique identity through a deep appreciation of culture, traditions, literature and history, while connecting with communities across Asia and the people who speak the language or share the culture

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>** 
* To achieve this, the language learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* Performance-based tasks (show-n-tell, story-telling, poetry recital, group work, role play and games)
	* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) - A teaching approach that transitions students to eventually assume all the responsibility for their learning (self-directed learning).
	* e-Pedagogy
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI) 

**<font size="5">Our Key Programmes</font>** 

1. Mother Tongue Fortnight (P1-P6)
* Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight aims to create an immersive environment for learning and appreciating Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures. Students are exposed to a wide variety of activities such as Chinese puppet making, Chinese knot-tying, Batik and kite making, and Indian martial arts appreciation during these two eventful weeks, with the objective that these cultural activities would deepen our students' understanding of their cultural roots and promote the learning of MTL in a fun and engagement way.

2. Reading Programme (P1-P6) 
* Reading is instrumental to development of language competency. At AMKP, the MTL reading programme includes setting up reading corners in the classroom with interesting and age-appropriate story books, organisation of reading promotion activities such as book review and reading portfolio, and  partnership with the National Library Board for mass borrowing to promote MTL reading activities.

3. E-Learning Portals (P1-P6)
* E-Learning is an integral part in the teaching and learning of mother tongue languages, providing students with self-directed and self-paced learning beyond classroom hours using the following portals:
	* Etutoronline (CL): http://ezhishi.net
	* Maanavar Murasu (TL): https://www.tamilmurasu.com.sg/students/

4. Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) (P3-P4)
* Conducted by trained school teachers, MTSP focuses on building stronger foundation in students' oracy and literacy skills for our students who need additional support in their literacy development.
