**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Innovation Programme (IvP), an initiative from MOE Gifted Education branch, provides a unique opportunity for students to develop their problem solving and inventive skills and come up with innovative ideas or products. Students learn to be empathetic changemakers through the identification of everyday issues, using various brainstorming tools to create working prototypes in solving these issues.
