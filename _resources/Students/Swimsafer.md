**<font size="5">About SwimSafer</font>**

In Ang Mo Kio Primary School, all Primary 4 students are required to participate in the SwimSafer programme, organized by ActiveSG, to earn at least a Stage 1 certificate. Students who already have a SwimSafer or equivalent certificate may sign up with the school to pursue the next stage of the programme.&nbsp;

  

SwimSafer is an 8 week programme where students attend swimming lessons at Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex under the coaching of experienced coaches, provided by a school appointed vendor. At the end of 8 weeks, students complete a practical and a theory test in order to earn a certificate.
