**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Brass Band CCA aims to groom students to become confident individuals by providing them a platform to express themselves musically. Learning different genres of music has helped our students acquire the skill of reading musical notes. With a positive attitude and confidence in themselves as well as the team, our students work together to perform each musical piece beautifully and confidently.
