<p>Ang Mo Kio Primary School was the first school to be built in Ang Mo Kio
New Town which was being developed during the late seventies. For the first
three months, the new Primary 1 pupils were housed in Dorset Primary School.</p>
<p>On 10th April 1978, the pupils moved into its premises at 22, Ang Mo Kio
Avenue 3. They were joined by pupils and teachers from Jalan Kayu Primary
School which closed down that year. Mr Oh Choon Eng was our first principal.
On Friday, 12th October 1978, the school was officially declared opened
by Mr Yeo Toon Chia, then the Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio Constituency.</p>

<p>On 2nd January 2002, Kebun Baru Primary School and Ang Mo Kio Primary
School merged to form the new Ang Mo Kio Primary School. On 30th May 2002,
the school relocated to its present location at 20, Ang Mo Kio.</p>
<p>In April 2009, the school was earmarked for building expansion and reconstruction
under the Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing Schools (PRIME).
The school was one of the first 28 schools to acquire Phase 1 PRIME implementation,
driven by the movement to move all primary schools to a single-session
model to support higher quality primary education as recommended by the
Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI) Committee.</p>

<p>The reconstruction work began in Nov 2010 and was granted T.O.P. on Dec
2012. The school began its first single session operation on 2nd January
2013, boasting the latest facilities such as an all new, competition-ready
Indoor Sports Hall, a new classrooms block, new library facelift, new learning
support facilities, extended staff room, as well as provision of student-care
rooms for future planning needs.</p>
<p>These facilities will be able to support implementation of MOE-initiated
Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for our P1 and P2 pupils, and enhance
the existing PE. Art and Music (PAM) modules to create a holistic learning
experience for all its pupils here in Ang Mo Kio Primary School.</p>
