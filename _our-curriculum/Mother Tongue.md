**<font size="5">Learning Outcomes</font>** 
<br>Active Learners, Proficient Users
*<br>(Objective in the Teaching and Learning of MTL is to develop proficient language users)*

* **Communication** - This is a valuable skill for life and work. In addition to their mastery of the English language, proficiency and ability to communicate in MTL gives Singaporeans a competitive edge.
* **Culture** - Learning MTL enables our students to understand and develop their unique identity through a deeper appreciation of culture, traditions, literature and history. This is a critical base to preserve the transmission of cultural values and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.
* **Connection** - Proficiency in MTL enables our students to connect with communities across Asia and the people who speak that language or share that culture.

**<font size="5">Teaching Approaches</font>** 


* A variety of learning approaches and activities are organised, designed and taught to develop proficient users who can communicate effectively using the language in real-life contexts and apply it in inter-personal communication, so as to make MTL directly relevant to students and a living language. Such activities include more performance-based tasks (show-n-tell, story-telling, poetry recital, group work, role play and games).

* We leverage on our students’ familiarity and regular use of ICT for MTL learning. There is greater use of ICT platforms to create realistic, interactive settings that test students’ ability to use the language effectively and meaningfully.  The use of iMTL portal also strengthen oracy learning.

* Holistic Assessment (HA) - ongoing feedback to learners on how the can improve their learning. Formative approaches (e.g. skilful questioning techniques, regular and timely feedback, self and peer assessment) are integrated into everyday teaching and learning to help enhance students’ learning.

**Reading Programme**
<br>To ensure strong MTL reading programmes, schools has purchased more interesting and age-appropriate story books, set up reading corners in the classroom and organize wide ranging reading-promotion activities such as book review and reading portfolio. We also 
engage the National Library Board for mass borrowing to promote MTL reading activities.
