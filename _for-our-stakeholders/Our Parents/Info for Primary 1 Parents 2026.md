<p><strong>Families for Life Parenting Talk</strong>
</p>
<p>We would like to highlight the "<a href="/files/AMKPS_Empowering_your_child_to_thrive_in_Primary_One.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Empowering your child to thrive in P1</a>"
talk is scheduled from 10.30am to 11.30am in the School Hall. This valuable
session will cover challenges and adjustments children face, practical
strategies to support your child's academic, social and emotional well-being,
identifying signs of struggles with transition, and self-care tips for
navigating this phase. We strongly encourage you to register for this talk
using the <a href="/files/AMKPS_Empowering_your_child_to_thrive_in_Primary_One.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">QR code found on the EDM</a>,
which is organised in partnership with AllKin Family Service Centre. For

<p>The day will conclude with dismissal at 12.00pm, where parents/caregivers
can pick up their child at the foyer, or children may leave via school
bus or be collected by their student care centre.</p>
<p>We warmly encourage all parents to attend the day's proceedings if you
are available. This is truly a momentous occasion - your child's first
day of formal education - and your presence would make it even more meaningful
for them.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions about the schedule or require assistance
with the online registration for the parenting talk, please do not hesitate

child on this exciting milestone.</p>
