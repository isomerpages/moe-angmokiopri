&gt;Character and Citizenship Education

**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**

* At AMKP, we believe in holistic education that grows a child as a whole. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is therefore an integral part of an all-round education for our students. 

* Through student-centric, intentional and coherent CCE learning experience in AMKP, we aim to develop a confident leader of self and for others with good character, resilience, social-emotional well-being, future readiness and the dispositions of a joyful learner, a confident person, and a caring citizen.

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**

* Student-centricity: Understanding our students’ needs and interests when designing CCE learning experiences, focusing on student engagement and voice to empower them to derive personal meaning from their learning experiences
* Intentionality: Designing and carrying out learning experiences with intentionality, and not leaving learning to chance with clear intended learning outcomes and purposeful application of pedagogical approaches while engaging students cognitively and affectively.
* Coherence: Purposeful integration of CCE within a whole-school approach in a coherent way across the total curriculum.
* A wide variety of CCE Pedagogical Approaches: Purposefully adopting pedagogical approaches that are developmentally appropriate – Explicit Skills Instruction Approach, Experiential Learning Approach, Values Clarification Approach 
* A Caring and Enabling School Environment: Creating a caring and enabling school environment characterised by caring and responsible leadership, a pervasive growth mindset, emotional and physical safety, and a focus on learning and development of students, teachers and all other members of the school community.

1. CCE (Form Teacher Guidance Periods) (P1-P6)
* CCE(FTGP) is conducted at all levels weekly. At AMKP, form teachers work together to have one-on-one conversations with their students, which enhances the teacher-student relationship. Interaction activities during lessons also foster social skills and encourage peer support and bonding among students.

2. CCE (Mother Tongue Languages) (P1-P6)
* CCE (Mother Tongue Languages) forms part of the explicit teaching and learning of moral values, by using cultural stories, practices, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language. Students explore how values are lived in the past in our communities and the relevance of these values to our lives and today’s context. For students who offer the non-Tamil Indian Languages or are exempted from taking MTL, lessons will be taught in English. Students would be able to put good values into practice, be responsible in their actions, cultivate good communication and social skills, develop good habits as a result of consistently doing what is right and good and promote harmony and social cohesion in a multiracial and multi-religious society

3.PAL (Programme for Active Learning) (P1-P2)
* PAL is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 students. PAL offers learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful. PAL contributes to the development of soft skills in our students such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others. The programme encourages students to have a lively curiosity about the world they live in and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.

4.Sexuality Education
* At Primary 5 and 6, specially trained teachers guide our students in understanding and manging the various changes and challenges they face at the onset of puberty. Topics include the changes involved in puberty, building healthy relationships and the importance of family, attitudes and values towards physical intimacy. More details about MOE’s sexuality education can be found [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/sexuality-education/scope-and-teaching-approach).

5.Mental Health
* Mental Health Education is one of the key features of the CCE curriculum. Through these lessons, students are equipped with knowledge and skills to build their resilience, strengthen their mental well-being and resolve their challenges. For example, students learn to differentiate normal stress from distress and mental illness. They learn to break negative thinking patterns, overcome social emotional problems and seek help when they need to. Students are also taught to stand up against stigma around mental health issues.
