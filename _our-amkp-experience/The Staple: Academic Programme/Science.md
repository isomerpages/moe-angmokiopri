**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**

* Through the teaching and learning of science in AMKP, we hope to inculcate in our students a passion for exploring science through inquiry and experiential learning.

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**

*   To achieve this, the science learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* Inquiry-based approach with strategies such as concept mapping, demonstration, games, investigation and problem solving 
	* 5E Instructional Model (engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation)
	* Science Note-Booking 
	* Learning Journeys 
	* e-Pedagogy 
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies 
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI) 

**<font size="5">Our Key Programmes</font>**

1. Science Learning Journeys (P1 - P6)
* Science Learning Journeys are organised to provide students with experiences to stimulate their curiosity to learn more about Science and to build on their interests. Through these out-of-classroom experiences, students will explore, discover and experience science in everyday life while consolidating process skills and adopting mental attitudes that are important in scientific inquiry

2. Hydroponics Programme (P3-P6)
* This programme provides our students with first-hand experience in growing green leafy vegetables using the Dynamic Root Floating Technique (DRF). Students also learn the technique of seeding, maintenance of the nutrients supply and the process of harvesting, thereby gaining a deeper insight into urban farming and making connections between classroom learning and real world.

3. Science Eco-Garden Learning Trail and Automated Urban Farming (P3-P6) 
* This in-house learning trail and urban farming programme facilitates experiential learning for our students from soil-based planting to using assistive technology i.e. farmbots (arduino, coding) to automate parts of the farming process.&nbsp; This spiral curriculum seeks to inspire students to be advocates of sustainable food sources, making linkages from science curricula to STEM and to larger national issue of food scarcity.
4. Science Note-Booking (P3-P6)
* Encourages and enhances students’ natural curiosity and motivation for learning and connecting science to their everyday life. This helps students to develop a deeper understanding of science concepts and communicate their understanding of these concepts.
5. Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme (P4-P5)
* Conducted by teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy, this programme aims to engage our High Progress Learners in Science in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through an inquiry approach.
