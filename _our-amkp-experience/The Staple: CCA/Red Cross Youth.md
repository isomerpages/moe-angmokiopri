**<font size="5">About</font>**

* The Red Cross Youth CCA aims to instil the Red Cross Youth spirit and strengthen core values such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all members. Red Cross Youths are groomed to become good citizens with strong senses of civic responsibility to show care and concern for fellow members of the community through the acquisition of life-saving knowledge and skills such as basic first-aid. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.
