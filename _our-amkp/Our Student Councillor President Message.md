<p>Dear fellow AMKPians,</p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Hailey Tan from 6 Respect. Throughout the 6 years I have spent
in AMKP, I’ve grown and learned a lot. With the many opportunities and
programmes available here, I was certainly able to pick up new skills and
learn valuable lessons in the course of my journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ASPIReaders programme which I was a part of, helps the younger students&nbsp;
improve their reading skills. As a mentor, I was able to help my juniors
read and understand the books they are reading. Through this program, I
am not only able to help my juniors but also build bonds with them through
the time spent together as they improve and develop a joy for reading.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other examples are the various stretch programmes I have been involved
in, include the E2K, Maths Olympiad, and Innovation programmes. These programmes
have allowed AMKPians like myself, extend our learning beyond the regular
syllabus, and as the intent suggests, stretch us to reach greater heights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More broad-based programmess like our very own AMKP Kaleidoscope showcase
provides an opportunity for students to showcase their talents; through
performing items which pertain to&nbsp; PE, Music, Art, and English related
exploits. This lets students showcase areas of themselves others may not
otherwise have the opportunity to learn.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other things I recall fondly in my time here include the unique Hari Raya,
Deepavali, Chinese New Year, Racial Harmony and National Day celebrations!
Students are engaged through the sampling of certain traditional programmes
and activities. Learning about the festival come alive&nbsp; through presentations,
hands-on activities like craft, food tasting, quizzes and exhibitions with
the support of fellow student subject champions, teacher mentors and parent
volunteers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lastly and most memorable are what all students look forward to: Learning
Journeys! I had the opportunity to visit many places and exhibitions around
Singapore, like Gardens by the Bay, the various heritage museums, and even
attend National Education Shows, namely the NDP and Chingay! Level camps
for Primary 5 and 6 cohorts are yet another example of how these excursions
are intended to not just entertain but also grow beyond the confines of
our classrooms.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The programmes designed by the school allows me to grow and develop both
my soft and hard skills. I truly value and appreciate the opportunities
that I have been given to rise beyond just knowledge within our books to
experience learning through authentic settings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the president of the Student Council, I’ve also had additional opportunities
others may not have had the privilege of experiencing - honing my leadership
and teamwork skills, through the Values in Action (VIA) initiative we plan
for the elderly which helps us contribute and serve beyond the school into
our community. Through this initiative, we connect with members of the
public and serve others thinking of others beyond ourselves. In addition
to this, we also get to plan certain school events which include both celebrations
and ceremonies thus strengthening our bonds and teamwork as a council.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the start, I was unsure of my role as Student Council President and
worried I wouldn’t be able to serve my peers adequately, but after going
through various projects, I’ve grown and found a deep purpose and meaning
in serving. I am better able to understand the importance of listening
to everyone’s voice and seeking my fellow students’ feedback and suggestions.
It has truly been an honor to serve others at AMKP.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I hope everyone has the chance to experience such a fulfilling and enriching
time here. I also hope all AMKPians appreciate and enjoy the different
programmes and learning opportunities AMKP has to offer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After my years in AMKP, I hope the skills and values that I’ve learnt
will be put to good use for many more years to come. Learning never stops,
so I hope to continue to cultivate my leadership skills and be given the
opportunity to serve wherever I may be. Let’s all continue to Rise and
Shine to be the best version of ourselves!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Yours sincerely</strong>,</p>
<p>Hailey Tan</p>
