&gt;**Social Studies**

**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**
* Through the teaching and learning of social studies in AMKP, we hope to nurture informed, concerned, and participative citizens who understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world we live in and appreciate the complexities of the human experience.


**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**

* To achieve this, the Social Studies learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* Inquiry Approach
	* Performance-based tasks (individual and group)
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies 
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI) 
 

**<font size="5">Our Key Programmes</font>**

1. Field-based learning through Learning Journeys
* Field-based learning through Learning Journeys allows the students to contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting, thus enabling the learning of concepts and content. Students are able to conduct hands-on exploration in a focussed area of study, thus being engaged in multi-sensory learning. As part of engaging students’ interest in inquiry, field-based learning also motivates and sustains their interest in the subject matter as they learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.

2. Performance Tasks
* Performance task is the mode of assessment that is adopted to best reflect the students’ ability to translate and transfer key knowledge, skills and values in a new context. The performance tasks allow students to apply the knowledge, skills and values in a real-world context to showcase their learning and understanding of the theme.

3) Values-in-Action through Social Studies
* Values-in-Action (VIA) is a Key Student Development Experience (SDE) that aims to nurture socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. Using their knowledge from their lessons they engender projects to share their learning in the community to contribute meaningfully.
