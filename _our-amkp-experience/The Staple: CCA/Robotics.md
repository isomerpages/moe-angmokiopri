**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Robotics Club nurtures studentsâ€™ creativity and innovation while equipping them with essential life skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. Through hands-on learning, students design, build, and program robots to tackle real-life challenges, fostering critical thinking and teamwork.

Using age-appropriate kits like LEGO Education SPIKE, they learn STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts in a way that promotes curiosity, perseverance, and innovation. This helps students to develop a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving, preparing them for future technological advancements while making learning enjoyable.
