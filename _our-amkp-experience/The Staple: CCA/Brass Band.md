**<font size="5">About</font>**

* The Brass Band CCA aims to develop the students' interest in and appreciation of music as they grow into confident individuals. Students will be given opportunities to explore different genres of music as well as musical instruments. During CCA sessions, they will be able to learn to read musical notes and work collaboratively to make music while enriching their learning in the aesthetic domain.
