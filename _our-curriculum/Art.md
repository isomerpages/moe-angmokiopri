**<font size="5">Teaching Approaches</font>**

In Ang Mo Kio Primary School, art lessons are planned and developed with the aim of inculcating in pupils a deep appreciation in the values of art in the lives of students and the world they live in via the 4E approach namely **experience, exposure, expression and enrich.**

In the **Experience domain**, pupils experience a wide variety of conventional and nonconventional materials and tools , media and art forms. This allows pupils to experiment and innovate.

In the **Exposure domain**, pupils will go on Museum Based Learning at Art Museums (e.g. National Gallery Singapore, ArtScience Museum) to get the first-hand experience and exposure to seeing authentic artworks. This allows pupils to deepen understanding of the connection of art to culture, society and world they live in. The whole school is also exposed to different art forms via the art assemblies and art events (e.g. Awesome week annually.

In the **Expression and Enrich domains**, pupils are able to demonstrate a mastery of the different art skills taught at different levels and showcase their artworks on School and national platforms, School ArtXpace and ArtXcapade (outside school) as well as SYF visual art.

**<font size="5">For Parents</font>**

The Art Department of Ang Mo Kio Primary School urges you to join us in our effort to cultivate a self-directed learner who is able to appreciate art and is confident in using art to express himself/ herself. The child upon entering AMKPS needs to keep a A3 black art portfolio which will be used throughout his/ her 6 years of art curriculum. We need parents’ support to help the children to be responsible for their materials and ensure they are kept in school during the school term.
