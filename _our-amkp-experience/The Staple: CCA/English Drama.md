&gt;**English Drama**

**<font size="5">About</font>**

The English Drama CCA aims to develop confident and expressive individuals who appreciate the performing arts through exposure, experience and involvement in drama. While learning to appreciate theatre performances of different styles (e.g. Puppetry), we hope that students will develop social and emotional competencies and work collaboratively to achieve common artistic goals while performing on stage. We hope students can further develop their imagination to enable them to in turn develop inventive ideas and to raise their self-confidence.
