**<font size="5">Learning Outcomes</font>**
1. To develop digital literacy in our students by building their IT skills to Curate, Create and Connect. 
2. To create future ready citizens who are responsible digital learners.

**<font size="5">Teaching Approaches</font>**

The IT department strives to provide a conducive and supportive environment so that both students and teachers can benefit from the vast potential that IT driven learning can provide. We also strive to build capabilities in both students and teachers so that we can all be confident in using IT. 

Cyber-wellness is also a key concern for us. All of us can attest to the fact that we are living in a World where Technology can be a double edged sword. Programmes such as FTGP lessons and the Cyber-wellness Ambassador Programs are some of the ways that we promote the responsible use of technology.

**<font size="5">Key Programs</font>**

**Baseline ICT Skills**<br>
Students are taught ICT skills progressively every year so as to prepare them for IT driven learning methods both here in Ang Mo Kio Primary School and also in the higher learnig institutes. Started in 2019, Ang Mo Kio Primary has since been designing its Baseline ICT Skills lessons based on the "Curate, Create, Connect" framework provided by ETD.  From 2020, we will move a step further by embedding Baseline ICT Skills learning into our standard curriculum so as to make learning more visible and authentic.

**Cyber-wellness Programmes**<br>
Cyber-bullying, inappropriate materials on the internet and fake news are serious things that we should all be concerned about. Which is why Ang Mo Kio Primary is very concerned about producing responsible digital learners. We will engage our pupils to learn about cyber-wellness through our weekly FTGP lessons and the Cyber-wellness Ambassadors Programme. 

**Home-based Learning (E-Learning Day)**<br>
To promote self-directed learning, the school will set aside time for home-based learning. Students will be assigned online lessons through the Student Learning Space (SLS) which they will have to complete at home. See schedule below for Home Based Learning.
