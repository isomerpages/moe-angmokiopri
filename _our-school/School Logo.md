This design takes the concept of the flaming desire to achieve the best and to aspire.

  

The three twirls represent the cognitive, physical, and moral development of our students.

  

The upward movement of the twirls signifies the aspiration to aspire and all-round education represented by the sphere.

  

The circular band symbolises the collaborative efforts between the school and the community to inspire our students in their pursuit of excellence.

  

Collectively, these culminate in an individual who is able to contribute to society and meet the challenges of an ever-changing world.
