<p><strong>Our School Rules</strong>

<p><strong>1. Respect for Singapore and the School</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and
take the Pledge. Students will take the Pledge with the right fist placed
over the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Singapore citizens must stand at attention during flag-raising ceremony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are to sing the school song respectfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are expected to uphold the reputation of the school at all times.
When students are dressed in their school attire, they represent the school
and must be well-behaved, both in and outside of the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Attendance is compulsory. All students are to be in school by 7.30 a.m.
for the flag-raising ceremony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students must attend school regularly so that they can benefit fully from
the school’s programmes and activities. Parents are to note the start and
end dates of each term in the academic year and refrain from taking children

learning.</p>
</li>

by the school.</p>

<p>If a student is unwell, he/she should see a doctor and obtain a medical

accept medical certificates from general practitioners, the polyclinics
and other medical institutions (doctors registered with the Singapore Medical
Council).</p>

<p>All documents/letters to validate a student’s absence from school must
be submitted to the Form Teacher upon the student’s return to school. The
school will only accept up to 5 parent’s/guardian’s letters in a year.</p>

as truancy and appropriate consequences will be meted out.</p>
