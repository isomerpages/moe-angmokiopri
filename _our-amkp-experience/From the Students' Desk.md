<p>Throughout my years in AMKP, I have not only grown academically, but also personally. The school has provided me with many opportunities to step out of my comfort zone, challenge myself, and develop skills that go beyond books and classroom. Each experience has shaped me into the person I am
today.</p>
<p>Those myriad of activities we experience, push us to persevere when faced with challenges and help us develop confidence in our abilities. Through these opportunities, I learned that growth happens when we dare to stretch ourselves.</p>
<p>One such meaningful experience is being involved in programmes that allow us to give back to others. Initiatives like ASPIReaders provide students with the opportunity to mentor younger peers in their reading. Through guiding my juniors patiently and encouraging them, I have learnt the values
of empathy, responsibility, and the joy of serving. These moments have reminded me that leadership begins with small acts of care.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I have also had the experience of joining an innovation programme (IvP), and through this experience it has not only taught me to think of creative solutions to life's problems, but also equipped me with many skills such as creativity and perseverance that will certainly stand me in good stead in the future.</p>
<p>Through the various commemorative events and celebrations which are an important part of my school experience, I have learnt to appreciate our diversity and witnessed how it strengthens our unity. Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali, Racial Harmony Day and National Day celebrations are not simply festive events for me. Through performances, interactive booths, craft activities, quizzes and exhibitions, I have gained a deeper understanding of different cultures and traditions we cherish as a community.
These shared experiences have also helped to bring us closer together as
one AMKP family.</p>
<p>The learning Journeys and P5 level camp have also yielded lasting memories and formed deep impressions in my heart and mind. From visiting iconic places such as Gardens by the Bay and the different heritage museums, to attending National Education Shows like the NDP and Chingay Parade with my fellow student councillors, the vibrancy of Singapore’s culture has come alive for me. Through our Primary 5 camp, the values of resilience,
teamwork and independence were truly a lived experience, helping me grow both as a student and as a leader.</p>
<p>Serving as Student Council President at AMKP will surely be one of the most meaningful chapters of my educational journey. In helping to organise school events and plan Values-in- Action activities for the elderly, I have gleaned that leadership is not about power — but service. It is about listening to different perspectives, representing voices, and working together
towards a common vision which I hope will ultimately lead to a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Initially, I had my reservation about fulfilling this role well. However, with the guidance of my teachers and the support of my fellow student councillors, I have gained greater confidence and discovered my purpose through serving others. It is truly an honour to contribute.</p>
<p>AMKP is more than just a school to me — it is a place where we Rise, Shine, and Grow. Thank you for the opportunities and lessons.</p>
<p>As we move forward this year, I hope every AMKPian will cherish every experience, embrace every challenge, and make the most of the opportunities afforded them. Let us continue to support one another to Rise and Shine to become the best versions of ourselves!</p>
<br>Yours in service,
<br>Jiyoo Hong
<br>Student Council President (2025-2026)<br>
