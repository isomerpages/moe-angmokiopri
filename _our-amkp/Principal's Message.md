Happy New Year and welcome to the 2025 school year! Before I begin, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our former Principal, Mrs. Wong, for her leadership in establishing the strong foundations that I now have the privilege of building upon as we move our school forward.

**What defines the education at Ang Mo Kio Primary School?**

At the heart of our school is a commitment to providing a safe, inclusive, and engaging environment where every student can thrive. My dedicated team and I are passionate about supporting our students’ academic growth, emotional well-being, and overall success.

We firmly believe in the unique potential of every child. Recognizing that each student is different, our goal is to nurture their individual strengths and passions while helping them become confident persons, joyful learners and caring citizens. By fostering these qualities, we are preparing them not only for academic success but for a future where they can positively contribute to society.

In our mission to care, guide, and inspire every student, we recognize that strong partnerships with parents are essential. We encourage all parents to remain actively involved in your child’s education and to reach out to us with any questions, concerns, or suggestions. Open communication is the cornerstone of our shared success, and we deeply value the partnership we have with you in supporting your child’s development. Together, we can ensure that each student reaches their fullest potential.

As Principal, the greatest privilege is witnessing the growth of our students throughout their years in the school. I urge all our partners to continue working closely with us in nurturing not only academic growth but personal development across various domains. Let us take the time to recognize and celebrate every step of progress, no matter how small. Such affirmation is vital in helping our students become lifelong learners. The roles we play collectively is key to our students’ success.

Let us welcome 2025 with positivity, optimism and confidence. Let’s _Rise_ and _Shine_ together as a strong AMK Primary family.

**Sincerely,**

Mr. Muhammad Farizal  
Principal
