**<font size="5">Our Aim</font>**

* Through the teaching and learning of mathematics in AMKP, we hope to nurture skillful and confident problem solvers with positive attitudes to mathematics , well-equipped with cognitive, meta-cognitive, reasoning and communicative skills to solve problems in a variety of authentic contexts

**<font size="5">Our Approach</font>**

* To achieve this, the mathematics learning experience in AMKP is made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:
	* FREMC-structured lessons: Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation
	* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR): ‘I do. We do. You do’ guided practice
	* Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (**CPA**) approach 
	* **UnPAC!** - **U**nderstand, **P**lan, **A**ct and **C**heck
	* Mathematical Journaling to emphasise communication and reasoning skills
	* Blended Learning via Student Learning Space (SLS) and Koobits
	* Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies 
	* Differentiated Instruction (DI) 

**<font size="5">Our Key Programmes</font>**

1. Math Fi.e.s.t.a (P1 - P6)
* Math **Fi.e.s.t.a** (***FI***nancial literacy, ***E***xploration, ***S***cience, ***T***echnology, ***A***ppreciation) is AMKP’s refreshed and distinctive mathematics programme, that provides students with rich learning experiences within and beyond the classroom, to ignite the joy of learning mathematics, and make learning visible, inclusive and authentic. 

2. Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme (P1-P2)
* This specialised early intervention programme conducted by LSM-trained teachers helps students who need additional help with Mathematics to develop basic numeracy skills. Students are identified to attend this programme through screening conducted upon school entry. 

3. ICAN Programme - Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (P3-P6)
* The ICAN programme aims to better support and motivate students to acquire knowledge and skills in numeracy, enhance memory retention and raise students’ confidence levels in Mathematics through intervention strategies that are guided by research. These lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation. 

5. Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme (P4-P5)
* Conducted by school teachers who have been trained in the E2K pedagogy, this programme aims to develop the mathematical reasoning skills of High Progress Learners in Mathematics and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.
