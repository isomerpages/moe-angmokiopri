&gt;OUR AMKP FACTOR


<img src="/images/About%20Us/40th%20Anniversary/AMKPFactor.png" style="width:85%">


What makes us who we are?

We identify in each AMKP graduate our unique AMKP Factor – pupils who are leaders of self and for others, with a passion for excellence.&nbsp; Indeed, our pupils play an essential role in shaping our identity.&nbsp; As one AMKP family as part of our 40th&nbsp;Anniversary celebrations, we will set up a School Identity Wall to document our pupil’s creed and outcomes for present and future AMKP pupils to embrace and champion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Spaces in school are where meaningful learning takes place, defining a part of our AMKP Factor.&nbsp; We have also set up our Counselling Room, Restorative Room and ArtXSpace to better cater to the needs of our pupils, to create a school environment that is more conducive for learning and reflecting, and expressing their creativity.

Check out this space for updated photos of our ArtXpace and Identity Wall!
