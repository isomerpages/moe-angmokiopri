<p><strong>About</strong>
</p>
<p>The Red Cross Youth CCA is committed to promoting values such as compassion,
passion, and professionalism in all our members. Our Red Cross Links engage
in a range of enriching activities, including first aid training, foot
drills, and service education. Beyond school-based events, our Links also
participate in a variety of programmes and competitions organised by Red
Cross Youth, such as the First Aid Championship (FAC), Disaster and Risk
Reduction Championship (DRRC), Ambassadors of Blood Championship (ABC),
Linkamania Camp, World Red Cross Day, and Grateful Hearts. Through these
diverse and engaging activities, our Links develop adaptability, resilience,
and confidence as collaborative team players.</p>
