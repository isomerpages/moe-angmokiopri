*"Every student can learn, just not on the same day or in the same way." – George Evans*

I believe that every child has the potential to learn and grow, though each does so in their own time and in their own unique way. As educators, we can recognize and respect these differences, adapting our teaching to meet each child’s individual needs and strengths. By creating a nurturing environment that celebrates diversity, sparks curiosity, and supports emotional well-being, we can make learning a meaningful and joyful journey. When we do this, we not only help children reach their full potential but also prepare them to navigate and thrive in an ever-changing world with confidence and resilience.

Sincerely,

Ms Tan Siew Khim 
<br>Vice-Principal
