<p>&gt;<strong>Physical Education</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Aim</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Through the teaching and learning of Physical Education (PE) in AMKP,
we hope to develop in students the knowledge (Head), attitude (Heart) and
skills (Hand) to pursue and enjoy a physically active and healthy lifestyle
and enable them to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical
skills, practices and values to enjoy active and healthy living.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To achieve this, the Physical Education learning experience in AMKP is
made “visible, inclusive and authentic” with the following approaches:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Direct Instruction and Demonstration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games Concept Approach (GCA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sport Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR) - A teaching approach that transitions
students to eventually assume all the responsibility for their learning
(self-directed learning).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formative Assessment (FA) Strategies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiated Instruction (DI)</p>

<p>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) – Sports &amp; Games and Outdoor Education
Modules (P1-P2)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Programme for Active Learning (PAL) is an integral part of the curriculum
for Primary 1 and 2 students offering active, hands-on and meaningful learning
experiences for our lower primary students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sports and Games Modules for Primary 1 and 2 students allow students
to be engaged in a variety of sports and games activities, e.g. fundamental
movement, movement exploration, creative movement and modified sports and
games. This engagement promotes interactions among the students and enable
them to develop their interpersonal and social skills, attitudes and values
in a sports context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Outdoor Education Modules for Primary 1 and 2 students expose them
to the NParks Kids for Nature Programme. P1 students learn to appreciate
outdoor setting and realise that there are many things to be discovered
such as nature, clouds, sun and wind, which cannot be found indoors. P2
students learn to orientate themselves in school using pictorial map/directions
and appreciate nature and Singapore’s rich biodiversity through the study
of trees</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Kaleidoscope (P1-P6)</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Believing in student voice, the Kaleidoscope provides a platform for students
to showcase their interests and talents in sports skills. They can also
do short presentations about their sports idols, passion for a particular
sport or how they can adopt active and healthy living habits to keep themselves
fit and healthy.</p>
