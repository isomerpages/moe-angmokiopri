<p><strong>A Heartfelt Thank You from the PSG EXCO</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude for the successful and
ongoing partnership between PSG and AMKP. This collaboration has truly
benefitted our students and enhanced their school experiences. We are deeply
appreciative of the support, dedication, and partnership of all parents
and teachers in the following initiatives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>P1 Orientation: The event was a great success in introducing new parents
to AMKP, creating a welcoming atmosphere for both parents and students,
and ensuring that our young learners are supported from the very start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AMKPS Kaleidoscope: This vibrant programme gave our students the opportunity
to showcase their talents, boosting their confidence and allowing the school
community to celebrate their creativity and achievements of their peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AMKPS Recess Activities:&nbsp; With your involvement and partnership,
we were able to provide fun and engaging recess experiences for all students.
Your thoughtful supervision and creativity in planning and conducting the
games have made a significant impact on our children’s joyful learning
and social development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recess Support: Parent volunteers play an essential role in creating a
safe and inclusive environment during recess. Your involvement ensures
every child has a positive and enjoyable experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“It Takes a Village to Raise a Child”</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are incredibly grateful to all the Parent Volunteers whose efforts
continue to strengthen our school community. Your hard work has been vital
in enhancing parent engagement and creating an environment where our students
can thrive and grow. &nbsp;The positive feedback we received reflects just
how much these uplifting initiatives have resonated with our school community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership is a powerful example of what we can achieve when we
come together as a school, with the shared goal of supporting our students’
growth and success. We are excited about continuing these efforts and encouraging
even more parents to join us via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXSgGx-O5FxuGYfX8tMPCdoPB77jZBeA1jrmNShy0yGqI9iQ/viewform" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>.
&nbsp;Together, we can create an even stronger, more supportive environment
for our children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your invaluable contributions, and we look forward
to the continued success of our partnership.</p>
