**<font size="5">Learning Outcomes</font>**

* Develop in pupils the knowledge (Head), attitude (Heart) and skills (Hand) to pursue and enjoy a physically active and healthy lifestyle. 
* Enable students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.

**<font size="5">Teaching Approaches</font>**

Physical Education (PE) is about movement therefore, in Ang Mo Kio Primary School, we base our PE curriculum on this philosophy. Movement is fundamental and essential to life, work, and play. Movement competency facilitates participation and allows individuals to derive pleasure and satisfaction from physical activities. An individual who can move proficiently has the skills and knowledge related to movement and values purposeful moving for life. Physical Education, therefore, is responsible for helping students take on the responsibility of learning by providing them with the capacity to make reasoned and wise choices through a lifelong process of change.

We, as Physical Education teachers, consciously make use of movement as the primary medium to reach and teach the whole child.To help inculcate the habit of an active lifestyle in our pupils,  the AMKP PE curriculum provides a range of learning experiences to develop our pupils’ overall physical development. The lower primary level focuses on the mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with the application of movement concepts, to develop pupils’ performance in efficiency, effectiveness and versatility. Once the foundation is laid, the upper primary level extends on to the mastery of discrete skills to focus on more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and skills application in more recognisable forms of activity and games.

By the end of P6, all pupils will have experienced the 7 key PE learning areas namely, Dance, Games and Sports, Gymnastics, Outdoor Education, Physical Health and Fitness, Athletics (P3 to P6) and Swimming (P4 only).

**<font size="5">Key Programmes</font>**

1. Sports Carnival (P3-P6)

Every year, the PE department organises the Sports Carnival for the P3 to P6 pupils at the end of Term 1. Through this carnival, the school hopes that the pupils will develop intrinsic motivation and aptitude towards leading an active and healthy lifestyle. We also hope that our pupils will display positive social behaviour such as care and respect towards one another while striving for excellence in all the activities that they participate in.

During the carnival, pupils take part in either carnival-style games or represent their classes in inter-class games. It is a day of celebration as pupils, regardless of their abilities, have the opportunity to get active and be involved in physical activities. This year (2018), we injected the element of excellence through pair and scoreboard challenges in the activities.

We would also like to convey our appreciation to the Parent Support Group for their continual patronage during the Sports Carnival!

**<font size="5">Programme for Active Learning</font>**

* PAL is a major initiative to address the need for greater emphasis on non-academic programmes for all P1 and P2 pupils. 
* It consists of modules of activities in 4 domains namely: **Sports & Games, Outdoor Education(OE), Performing Arts and Visual Arts**, which are carried out within the curriculum time.

**2. P5 Camp Resilience**

Every year, the Primary 5 cohort participates in a 3D2N adventure camp at one of the four MOE Outdoor Adventure Learning Centres (OALC). Usually conducted in the first week of Term 3, the camp aims to develop resilience and fortitudein our students, hence the name "Camp Resilience". The learning outcomes include:
* To develop confidence, resilience, ruggedness and a positive mindset to face new challenges;
* To develop 21st century competencies such as critical thinking and sound decision-making skills; and
* To develop the ability to work cooperatively and effectively in a team.

During the camp, activities such as team-building games, high and low rope elements and caving are conducted. To end the camp on a high note, everyone comes together at a campfire on the final night. This year (2018), the camp was successfully carried out from 28 to 30 June at Jalan Bahtera MOE OALC. Following are some highlights from the camp:

**3. Lower Primary Games Day (P1-P2)**

Every year, the P1 and P2 pupils look forward to the Lower Primary Games Day which takes place in conjunction with the Children’s Day celebration in October. This event is organised with the following objectives in mind:

* Pupils will develop an intrinsic motivation and aptitude towards leading an active and healthy lifestyle;
* Pupils will display positive social behaviour while striving for excellence through resilience and respect; and
* Pupils will be able to apply the skills learnt during PE lessons.

5 diverse relay games are planned for each level and are carried out at the school’s Basketball Court and Indoor Sports Hall. Each game requires the pupils to execute skills that they have learnt during their Physical Education lessons.

The event is also a platform for the pupils to practise and display the school values of Respect and Resilience. They wait patiently for their turn during the games and offer encouraging words to their peers. It is also evident that the pupils always put in their best effort to perform the skills and display the ‘never give up’ spirit.

At the end of the day, tokens in the form of sports equipmentare given to every child in attendance to encourage a healthy lifestyle. In addition, prizes are also awarded to the top three classes based on the total scores they receive. Everyone is a winner here in Ang Mo Kio Primary School!

The school would also like to place on record our appreciation to the parent volunteers who took time off from their busy schedules to support this event.

**4. P4 Swimsafer Programme**

SwimSafer is a national water safety programme developed to raise the standard of swimming proficiency in Singapore. The SwimSafer programme consists of six progressive stages, each comprising 12 hours of lesson time. Survival and activity skills are taught at each stage of the programme, with the pupil working progressively towards the next stage. At the end of each stage, each child receives a certificate indicating his/her individual skill achievements.

AMKP adopted this programme in an effort to ensure that all the pupils are water-safe and to also promote swimming as a healthy physical activity amongst the pupils. Being proficient in swimming also helps to open up the gateway for pupils to be involved in other water-related activities in future to adopt a healthy lifestyle.

This year, a total of 173 Primary 4 pupils participated in this programme. The lessons were conducted at Ang Mo Kio Swimming Complex. Pupils attended eight swimming lessons of 1.5 hours each from end-June to mid-October this year. At the beginning of the programme, the pupils were placed in small groups of 10, according to their individual swimming abilities. This allows the swimming instructors to tailor their lessons according to the pupils’ skills proficiency. During the programme, it was apparent that the pupils enjoyed the lessons thoroughly and they also showed resilience in wanting to learn a new and important life skill.

The school would like to thank the parent volunteers and teachers who acted as chaperones for this programme. Because of their dedicated supervision, the programme was carried out successfully.

**5. Sports Education Programme**

The Sports Education Programme (SEP) is a collaborative partnership between Sport Singapore (SportsSG) and the Ministry of Education (MOE). Under SEP, every school is provided with financial grants to aid the pupils to take up sports programmes at a subsidised rate. The SEP aims to advocate the importance of sports education, encourage sports participation in schools and increase sporting opportunities for our young learners.

In AMKP, we hope to expose our pupils to special sports activities that are not covered in the PE curriculum. Over the four years from P3-P6, pupils will be exposed to 4 different sports, conducted outside the curriculum hours. This year, these were the sports that our pupils were introduced to:

**6. P3 to P6 InterClass Competition (After Curricular Hours)**

To further provide more opportunities for the pupils to be active and resilient, AMKP PE department also organises after school activities such as inter-class competitions. These activities generate fun and promote a positive attitude towards continual participation in physical activities for health, fitness and enjoyment. They also provide authentic learning experiences for pupils to build their confidence and develop social skills.
