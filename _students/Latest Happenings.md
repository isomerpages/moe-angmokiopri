KidsConnect 2019 was a two-day affair that was organized by Playeum. Playeum is an Independent Registered Charity that supports children through play and creativity. As it is a public event, any young musicians, entrepreneurs, school drama clubs are invited to be a part of it.

We have been preparing for KidsConnect since September 2018. 2 musicians, a group of young entrepreneurs and the AMKP Drama Club represented our school at KidsConnect. The Drama Club watched 4 drama plays put up by other schools and participated in an art workshop conducted by Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Our musicians were very courageous as they performed for a crowd that they have never met before. The entrepreneurs also sold their crafts and earned a total of $349 of which 10% was donated back to Playeum for other children.
