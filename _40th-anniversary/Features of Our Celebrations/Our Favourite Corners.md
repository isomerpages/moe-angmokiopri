&gt;OUR FAVOURITE CORNERS


<img src="/images/About%20Us/40th%20Anniversary/FavCorner.png" style="width:75%">


Remember your favourite seat in the classroom – the one beside the windows?&nbsp; Or that corner in the library where you like to hide and read story books in after school?&nbsp; Or the stage in the hall where you had your first ever performance in front of the entire school?&nbsp; AMKP is our fort, our home, supporting us through good and bad times.&nbsp;

Our pupils identified their favourite corners in our school campus through creative expressions such as illustration, poetry, and photography. Join us as we walk you through our expressions of love for our school.
