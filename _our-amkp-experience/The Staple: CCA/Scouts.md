**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Scouts CCA strives to nurture our pupils into confident individuals who are committed to service. Our Cub Scouts develop essential skills such as First Aid, Outdoor Cooking, Track and Trail, Map Reading, Knotting, and Foot Drills, while gaining valuable knowledge about their country and community. Through participation in various events such as the South Area Orienteering Competition, Job Week, National Day Commemoration, and national camps, our Cub Scouts develop strong communication skills, teamwork, and resilience.
