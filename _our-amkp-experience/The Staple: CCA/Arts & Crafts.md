* The Arts &amp; Crafts Club provides opportunities for our students to enrich their learning in the aesthetic domain. Our students will learn the importance of imagination and expression as they are exposed to a wide range of art and craft forms that will enhance their individual creativity and encourage them to pursue their passion in the aesthetics.
