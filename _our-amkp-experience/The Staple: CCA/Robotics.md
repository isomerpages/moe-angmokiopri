&gt;**Infocomm Club - Robotics &amp; Makers Club**

**<font size="5">About</font>**

The Robotics Club nurtures students’ creativity and innovation while equipping them with essential life skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. Through hands-on learning, students design, build, and program robots to tackle real-life challenges, fostering critical thinking and teamwork.

Using age-appropriate kits like LEGO Education SPIKE, they learn STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) concepts in a way that promotes curiosity, perseverance, and innovation. This helps students to develop a strong foundation in coding and problem-solving, preparing them for future technological advancements while making learning enjoyable. 

The Makers Club CCA aims to ignite pupils’ interest in ICT in a fun and meaningful way through the use of digital media and technologies. During CCA sessions, our pupils will make use of their ICT skills to create prototypes to solve problems in daily life.
